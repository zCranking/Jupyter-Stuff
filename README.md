It was my first class after a while and coming back to coding. But I still had my coding energy and was able to start right where I left off in learning coding. This was the first class that I started using Jupyter Notebook. I was very suprised with that change, but I wasn't excited for the upcoming change and argued how thigns were fine the way we were doing. We weren't changing the language and were still using python. The main we changed to using that was because it already had installed some libraries such as panda and numpy. But that was it and me being me, I had a workaround which most people would have guessed. Just using ```pip install```, and then puting the name of the libraries. The only experience I had with Jupyter Notebook before this was when I was first learning python independently and was just exploring the world of python and what the language had to offer. When I first used it, I thought it would be a good way to test small lines of codes and was a good temporary solution for learning. But I thought to myself when using and working on bigger projects having a pythong file would be easier. But I couldn't have been more wrong. I am sure many people have different opinions but this is what I have to say, Jupyter Notebook can still be used for big projects but of course parts of them and having all of the parts work together through various files to build the final product. But it offeres a variety of organization that you might have to do manually, but many things that you still don't get while using a regualr python file and your choice of IDE. This project in class was only the start of my journey of exploring, learning, and hating Jupyter Notebook whilst learning python.
